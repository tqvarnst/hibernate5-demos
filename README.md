# hibernate5-demos
This repository contains some Hibernate 5.0 demos like:

* ResultMapping
* Native StoreProcedure calls
* Using java.time.* for improved Date, time and timestamp usage

The demos are implemented as Arquillian test cases using arquillian-persistance-dbunit to load data into the database to run the test. 

This demo requires a number of software like JBoss EAP 7 ER5 (not publicly available yet), see README in installs directory

This demos also requiers a docker environment and it will as part of the init script pull down the official PostgresSQL 9.4 database image.

To run the demo you also need to set docker-vm in /etc/hosts that points to the docker server (127.0.0.1) if you are running locally.
